It all started during the 2008 financial crisis, although back then we really had no idea something good (if anything good at all) could actually come about from the failure of the US banking system. What began as an attempt to help a sister renegotiate a 2nd mortgage balance during the Great Recession and help an uncle consolidate credit card accounts would eventually lead to our co-founders forming The Debt Relief Company.",

Years of trials and tribulations in the financial services industry helped develop our expertise and know-how of debt consolidation and various debt relief products (loan modifications, credit card resolution programs, traditional debt settlement programs, debt consolidation loans, etc). Until eventually, right time and right place. Previously strangers, an introduction from a friend of a friend in downtown Manhattan would lead our co-founders to form The Debt Relief Company in New York as it is known today.",
